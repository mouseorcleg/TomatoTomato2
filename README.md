*Todo List meeting Pomodoro timer* 

I will follow this 3 steps logic:
- [ ] Build the most simple Todo List possible;
- [ ] Add timer to it;
- [ ] Add custom notifications using CloudKit.

I will add bd when or if I need it. I will try to concentrate on getting the app up and running first, improve it later.

## Credits and acknowledgements
The first part of building this app will be going through the Swiftful Thinking tutorial: [SwiftUI Todo List](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwvDm4VfkdpheGqemblOIA7v3oq0MS30i)

In the next parts I will use multiple sources. I will credit them as we go. 

But I want to pay tribute to the Hacking with Swift and Stack Overflow beforehand, I will def go there more than one time.

*Wish me luck!*
